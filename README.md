# DynamoRest

Make AWS API Gateway implement a REST API on top of a DynamoDB table, deployed using a CDK script written in Java.

This repository contains the sample code for the [How to use Java CDK to define a DynamoDB-backed REST API with only AWS API Gateway](https://www.luminis.eu/blog/cloud-en/rest-api-on-dynamodb-with-aws-api-gateway-in-java-cdk/) blog.
It provides a complete working example.
Assuming you have AWS CDK installed (if not, look [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html))
and have a working Java environment,
all you have to do to deploy the solution is the run the following command:

`cdk deploy`

Enjoy!
